## DeepFake Detection

CS230 Project

Run `python cffn_tf/trainer.py` to train the model. This expects the
data\_paths defined at the top of the `cffn_tf/trainer.py` file to be
correct. TensorFlow1.0, Python3, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are
requirements (can all be found in Standard AWS Deep Learning AMI).
